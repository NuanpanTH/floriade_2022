# Consumer behavior Report on consumption of Thai agricultural products in the Netherlands (2022)

During the past few years, consumer behaviors have changed drastically because of the COVID-19 pandemic. A series of social-distancing measures aiming to mitigate the spread of the virus forced consumers to adopt new habits and lifestyle choices that influence how they live, work, and shop for their needs. These changes have prompted businesses to align their strategies to meet the consumer’s expectations.

Thailand leveraged the opportunities at the Thai Pavilion featured at the International Horticultural Expo to showcase the country’s food products and conduct a study on Dutch consumer behavior to understand the purchase patterns and preferences of different consumers.

This study was carried out to identify demographic factors affecting consumer behavior across the three product categories: fruits and vegetables, herbal products, and plants in the Netherlands.

Questionnaires were used to obtain relevant information from respondents at the Thailand Pavilion during the International Horticultural Exposition (EXPO 2022 Floriade Almere). There were 395 participants randomly selected to answer the questionnaires using a convenient sampling method. 

The study was examined using descriptive statistics such as frequency and mean. The relationship between the demographic factors and the purchasing behavior of the above-mentioned products was analyzed using a chi-square test of independence. 

In addition, due to the limited number of questions, the Apriori algorithm  was used to generate association rules showing correlations found from the most frequent product combinations. This technique allows us to identify the products customers regularly purchase together. The findings of this study are beneficial for Thai businesses to segment the target market and leverage this trait to expand their marketing strategies and strengthen their product positions.
